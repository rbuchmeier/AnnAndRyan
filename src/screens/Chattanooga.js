      <p>We hope to make travel less of a barrier to visit with our friends and family on the east side of the country, so this is our way to bring the party to you! (Apologies to those in other regions â€“ we wish we could have a party everywhere!) This reception will be a simple and casual affair planned to create space to just hang out and chat for anyone who wants to join us. </p>

      <p>Time:</p>
      <p>1:00 to 5:00 pm</p>

      <p>Place:</p>
      <p>Ooltewah SDA Church fellowship hall and lawn. 9209 Amos Road, Ooltewah, TN 37363</p>

      <p>Description:</p>
      <p>We will have finger food, photos, and lawn/group games you can choose to participate in. Show up any time between 1 and 5, and stay as long or short as you like. We will not have a specific program; rather we simply want to talk with you, take some pictures together, and play some games. Feel free to bring your own games and a picnic blanket if you wish!</p>
