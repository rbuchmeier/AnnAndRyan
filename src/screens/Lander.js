      <h3>July 10th, 2022</h3>
      <h3>Diamond H Ranch, Lander, WY</h3>

      <h4>Description:</h4>
      <p>We would love to celebrate our wedding with as many of our dear friends and family as possible! We have created our July 10 Lander Wedding Celebration intentionally after we are married â€“ and honeymooned! â€“ so that we can relax and spend the whole day with you for as long as you want to stay, instead of feeling itchy to rush off to our honeymoon afterwards. After all, many of you we donâ€™t get see very often! Our goal is to create a time and space that is accessible to anyone who would like to celebrate with us, when we can also connect with you in a relaxed and fun way. Feel free to bring a guest or pass on the invitation to other people who know us, and please do have them RSVP as well.</p>
      <p>To this end, we have chosen a simple potluck picnic style reception so we donâ€™t have to limit our guests by the cost of catering. We request that our local guests bring something to contribute to the potluck. Out-of-town guests, contribute as you are able. Please do RSVP so that we can estimate the number of guests compared with those who can bring food. We will provide drinks and dessert.</p>
      <p>This event will include both a sit-down ceremony and a picnic-style reception with lawn games. The wedding party will be formally dressed. Everything will be outdoors. Ranch tours will be available after lunch. Wear something that you feel comfortable in.</p>
      <p>We will have several segments to this celebration to allow for as much social opportunity as possible throughout the day (see the Itinerary). Feel free to come to any or all of them, and note your plans in your RSVP. We want you to enjoy yourself for as short or long as you want to attend!</p>
      <p>Please do not bring or consume alcohol until the After Party.</p>

      <h4>Ranch Info:</h4>
      <p>There is precious little cell phone service at the ranch. We can provide you access to our wifi if you need to connect to the outside world while you are with us.</p>
      <p>Please, do not bring pets to the ranch. The livestock guard dogs, while friendly to people, take their job seriously to protect the livestock from foreign animals. Your pet will not be safe on the ranch. If you have a pet in your car, your car will not be safe. </p>
      <p>Horses roam freely about the property (without fences). Some are sweet and friendly while others are wilder and more unpredictable. Please keep your distance unless you are with someone who lives at the ranch (Ryan, Ann, Ingrid or Roger). However, if you are with one of us, enjoy their company â€“ they love to be scratched!</p>

      <h4>Lodging:</h4>
      <p>We have block reservations for a limited number of discounted rooms at the Inn at Lander (Travelodge by Wyndham) for the night of July 8 through check out the morning of July 11. They are $123/night, discounted from $147/night. If you would like to stay there, reference Buchmeier Wedding when you call: (307) 332-2847. Holiday Inn Express and Rodeway Inn Pronghorn Lodge are also good hotels in Lander, and there are also Air BnB places as well. We recommend booking soon as Lander gets very busy in the summer.</p>
      <p>We can also accommodate limited primitive camping (or RV parking) at the ranch before and after the event. Please request information in your RSVP if you are interested. If you camp, please do not dig catholes; use the available restrooms.</p>

      <h4>Flying:</h4>
      <p>Riverton (RIW) is the closest airport to Lander (unless you fly your own plane, then you can land at the Lander Airport ðŸ˜‰). RIW is about a half hour from Lander and is tiny: United is the only commercial airline that flies there. See their website at https://centralwyomingairport.com/ for ground transportation and other information. Public transportation is limited in Wyoming. There is a bus service with WRTA (http://www.wrtabuslines.com/) and at least one Lyft car in Lander. Let us know if you need help figuring out travel. We can help arrange carpooling/shuttling between Lander and the ranch the day of the event. Other airports you can use in order of distance from Lander (and size) are: Rock Springs (RKS), Casper (CPR), Salt Lake City (SLC), and Denver (DEN). (Jackson (JAC) is closed for runway repairs.)</p>
      <p>Driving Directions:</p>
      <p>Please do not plug our address into your GPS. It will not take you to quite the right spot, and, weâ€™d like to keep it that way, so please use the following old fashioned driving directions. ðŸ˜Š</p>
      <p>These directions start from the intersection of Main Street and Baldwin Creek Rd. in Lander. From Main Street, go west on Baldwin Creek Rd. for about 7 miles. You will pass the high school on the right and then leave town. After several miles, you will cross a cattle guard, and a bit later, a second one. If you cross a third youâ€™ve gone too far. Look to your right and locate Red Butte (aptly named and easy to pick out). Looking from the road, the ranch is at the western toe of it. Follow the road until Baldwin Creek Rd. continues straight and turns to dirt, at which point you will be about even with the toe of Red Butte. (If you stay on the paved road, you will turn a sharp left uphill and the road becomes Squaw Creek Road, which will take you back to town. If you take this turn you will see low red cliffs to your left and cross a third cattle guard. This means youâ€™ve gone too far and should turn around. If you cross a fourth cattle guard youâ€™ve really gone too far, and if you end up back in town youâ€™ve gone about 7 miles too far.) Anyway, go straight on Baldwin Creek Rd. where it turns to dirt. You can recognize it by the stop sign and road sign on the left, and the row of mailboxes and two large log entryways on the right. Follow the dirt road, passing houses, to cross a yellow cattle guard. Please drive slowly (5 mph) past this point and look for loose animals on the road. Shoshone Lake Rd. will appear on your right. Look for parking directions at the intersection with Shoshone Lake Rd. and leave your vehicle where directed. To find the house, barns, and reception meadow area, go straight. Pass a house on your left, cross the wooden bridge, follow the road left, look for the second house on your left. No vehicles past this point. To find the meadow where the reception is, walk past the house, garage, woodshed, and cabin into the meadow beside the creek.</p>
